1. **URP Potion Liquidation Effect**:
   - Description: This project showcases a unique game mechanic where players collect various potions throughout the game world. When consumed, these potions provide temporary effects or boosts to the player character. Additionally, when the player character takes damage, there's a chance for these potions to shatter, creating a liquidation effect that alters the environment or affects nearby enemies. The type of effect could vary based on the potion consumed.
